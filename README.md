# Recession_Predictor

Recession Predictor is a small program that predicts US economic recessions using logistic regression. 
It uses leading economic indicators' composites, dates, and recession occurances from the last 50 years to learn how to best predict when a recession will occur, 
doing so with 87.92% accuracy. The data used can be found in "Documentation."

Recession Predictor is currently set up to predict regressions within the last 50 years, but it has the potential to predict recessions in the future as well.
Given projected leading economic indicator composites, it can predict when future economic recessions will occur.
